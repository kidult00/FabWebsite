## Assignment


> propose a final project that integrates the range of units covered, answering:
> 
  - what will it do?
  - who's done what beforehand?
  - what materials and components will be required?
  - where will they come from?
  - how much will it cost?
  - what parts and systems will be made?
  - what processes will be used?
  - what tasks need to be completed?
  - what questions need to be answered?
  - what is the schedule?
  - how will it be evaluated?

>  projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery
      of the skills covered

>   where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project

### Final project proposal

My final project is making a theremin-like instrument.

#### what will it do?

It's an old instrument invented by Russian engineer Leon Theremin. You can change the pitch by moving your hand near the instrument.

#### who's done what beforehand?

Many electronics and maker have made it. Gaudilab even made a opensource library [Open.Theremin](http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/). I'd like to make a simple version.

#### what materials and components will be required?

Hardware

- chip
- Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04

Software

- Arduino IDE
- New Ping Library for Arduino IDE
- [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) 
- [Maximillian / ofxMaxim](github.com/micknoise/Maximilian) addon for OpenFrameworks

Housing

- a shield or box
- antenna screws

#### where will they come from?
- Local electronic vender
- Taobao
- wood suply
- acrylic supplier
- Inventory from our fablab

#### how much will it cost?

- electornic parts roughly about ? USD
- wood parts about 30 USD

#### what parts and systems will be made?

- the circut
- the program
- the box/shield

#### what processes will be used?

- Project plan (Week1, Week17)
- Design the circut (Week6 - Electronics Design)
- Make the PCB (Week4 - Electronic Production)
- Make the circut (Week8 - Embedded Programming, Week11 - Input Devices, Week13 - Output Devices, Week15 - Networking and Communications)
- Test the instrument (Week16 - Interface and Application Programming)
- Design the housing (Week2 - CAD, Week9 - Mechanical Design, Week10 - Machine Design)
- Make the housing (Week3 - Computer-controlled cutting, Week7 - Computer-controlled machining)
- Design and make other components (Week5 - 3D scanning and printing, Week12 - Casting and Molding, Week14 - Composites)
- Assembly and test

#### what tasks need to be completed?
- study theremin principls
- design schematic in eagle
- design board in eagle
- buy components
- mill the borad
- soldering
- coding
- test input & output part
- design housing parts
- making housing parts
- assemble
- test

#### what questions need to be answered?
- theremin's principl
- how the circut works
- how to program input and output
- ...

#### what is the schedule?

- study theremin principls (6.9-6.11)
- design schematic in eagle (6.12)
- design board in eagle (6.13)
- buy components (6.15)
- mill the borad (6.18)
- soldering (6.18)
- coding (6.12-6.18)
- test input & output part (6.19)
- design housing parts (6.13-6.15)
- making housing parts (6.18-6.19)
- assemble (6.19)
- test (6.20-6.21)
