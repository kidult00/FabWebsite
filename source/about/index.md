Hi! I'm Lin Jie.  

I live in Guangzhou, south of China. It's a city full of people and delicious food. 

After four years studying Geographic Information System in Sun Yat-Sen University, I fell in love with STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics). After obtaining my master's degree, I got a position in a IT company.

I currently work for Wechat payment team as an interaction designer. In addition to design mobile user interface, I'm also insterestd in data visualization, ubiquitous computing, fluid interfaces and things like that.

The opportunity of attending Fab Academy excites me. Let's have fun in Fab Academy!

You can contact me via email: sysulj@gmail.com.
