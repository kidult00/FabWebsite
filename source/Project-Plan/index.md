I'm interested in making a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin). It's an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist

It is a simple radio frequency device which relies on the interaction of two oscillators to produce a range of musical notes. One oscillator serves as a reference while the second oscillator is free to be influenced by the capacitance of the player’s hand approaching the instrument’s pitch antenna. To achieve control over the volume of the sound produced by the instrument another oscillator arrangement is used.

Here's block diagram of a theremin. Volume control in blue, pitch control in yellow and audio output in red.

Hope that will be fun!

## principle

We can separate modules representing each functional unit of the instrument:

* Pitch reference oscillator
* Pitch control oscillator
* Mixer
* Volume control oscillator
* Volume resonant(共振) circuit and voltage controlled amplifier
* Audio amplifier
* Power supply
